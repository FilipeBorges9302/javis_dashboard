# Quickstart: Chat History Removal Feature

## Test Scenarios Walkthrough

### Prerequisites
1. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to `/chat` page
3. Ensure you have multiple chat sessions available for testing

### Scenario 1: Delete Individual Session
**Objective**: Verify users can delete a specific chat session

**Steps**:
1. Open chat interface at `/chat`
2. Observe the session list in the sidebar
3. Locate the delete button/option for a specific session
4. Click delete button for a non-active session
5. Confirm deletion in the confirmation dialog
6. Observe the session is removed from the list
7. Verify the deleted session is permanently gone after page refresh

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Delete button/option visible for each session
- ✅ Confirmation dialog appears before deletion
- ✅ Session removed immediately from UI after confirmation
- ✅ Session remains deleted after page refresh
- ✅ Associated messages are also deleted
- ✅ No errors in browser console

### Scenario 2: Delete Currently Active Session
**Objective**: Verify graceful handling when deleting the current session

**Steps**:
1. Select a session to make it active (messages visible)
2. Delete the currently active session
3. Confirm deletion
4. Observe behavior after deletion

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Current session is deleted successfully
- ✅ Another session is automatically selected (if available)
- ✅ If no other sessions exist, empty state is shown
- ✅ Messages area updates appropriately
- ✅ No broken UI state or errors

### Scenario 3: Bulk Delete All Sessions
**Objective**: Verify users can delete all chat history at once

**Steps**:
1. Ensure multiple sessions exist
2. Find and click "Delete All Sessions" or equivalent option
3. Read the bulk deletion confirmation dialog
4. Confirm the bulk deletion
5. Observe all sessions are removed
6. Verify empty state is displayed
7. Refresh page to confirm all sessions are gone

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Clear warning in confirmation dialog about deleting ALL sessions
- ✅ All sessions removed from UI after confirmation
- ✅ Empty state message displayed when no sessions remain
- ✅ Sessions remain deleted after page refresh
- ✅ User can create new session after bulk deletion

### Scenario 4: Cancellation Flow
**Objective**: Verify users can cancel deletion operations

**Steps**:
1. Initiate session deletion (individual or bulk)
2. When confirmation dialog appears, click "Cancel" or equivalent
3. Observe that no deletion occurs
4. Verify all sessions remain intact
5. Test cancellation for both individual and bulk deletion

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Cancel option clearly visible in confirmation dialogs
- ✅ No sessions deleted when cancelled
- ✅ UI returns to normal state after cancellation
- ✅ All sessions remain in their original state

### Scenario 5: Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify graceful error handling during deletion failures

**Steps**:
1. Test deletion when network is offline (simulate in browser dev tools)
2. Attempt to delete a session that might not exist
3. Observe error messages and UI behavior
4. Verify UI remains in consistent state after errors

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Clear error messages displayed to user
- ✅ UI state remains consistent (no partially deleted sessions)
- ✅ User can retry or cancel after errors
- ✅ Console errors provide debugging information

### Scenario 6: Loading States
**Objective**: Verify appropriate loading indicators during deletion

**Steps**:
1. Initiate session deletion
2. Observe loading states during the deletion process
3. Verify loading states for both individual and bulk deletion
4. Test on slower connections if possible

**Expected Results**:
- ✅ Loading indicators shown during deletion
- ✅ Delete buttons disabled during operation
- ✅ Clear visual feedback that operation is in progress
- ✅ Loading states resolve when operation completes

## Development Testing Commands

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run contract tests (after implementation)
npm test -- --grep "delete"
