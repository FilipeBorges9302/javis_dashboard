# Research: Chat History Removal

## Existing Implementation Analysis

### DELETE API Already Exists
**Decision**: Leverage existing `/api/chat/sessions/[sessionId]` DELETE endpoint
**Rationale**: The backend DELETE functionality is already implemented with cascade deletion of messages
**Alternatives considered**: Creating new bulk delete endpoint (will still be needed for "delete all")

### Component Architecture Pattern
**Decision**: Extend existing ChatInterface component with delete functionality
**Rationale**: Single-component architecture (360 lines) follows established pattern, maintains simplicity
**Alternatives considered**: Creating separate deletion components (rejected - over-engineering for this use case)

### State Management Pattern
**Decision**: Use existing React hooks pattern with optimistic updates
**Rationale**: Established pattern: `setSessions()`, error handling with rollback, consistent with current implementation
**Alternatives considered**: External state management libraries (rejected - violates constitution's simplicity principle)

### Storage Layer Integration
**Decision**: Extend existing file-based JSON storage with `ChatSessionStorage` class
**Rationale**: Cascade deletion already implemented, UUID-based, follows constitutional file-based storage requirement
**Alternatives considered**: Database storage (rejected - violates constitution)

## Deletion Patterns Research

### React Confirmation Dialog Pattern
**Decision**: Use native confirm() for initial implementation, upgrade to modal if needed
**Rationale**: Simplest approach, follows constitutional simplicity-first principle, consistent with zero-dependency approach
**Alternatives considered**: Custom modal components (can be added later if UX feedback requires it)

### Destructive Operation UX Pattern
**Decision**: Use existing shadcn/ui Button component with `destructive` variant
**Rationale**: Leverages existing design system, maintains visual consistency
**Alternatives considered**: Custom styling (rejected - existing components preferred)

### Error Handling Pattern
**Decision**: Follow existing console.error + user-visible error messages pattern
**Rationale**: Consistent with current implementation, matches constitutional logging approach
**Alternatives considered**: Complex error reporting (rejected - over-engineering)

## Testing Patterns Research

### React Testing Library Patterns
**Decision**: Use existing test structure with contract → integration → unit order
**Rationale**: Follows constitutional TDD requirements, maintains existing patterns
**Alternatives considered**: End-to-end testing only (rejected - doesn't follow constitutional test ordering)

### Destructive Operation Testing
**Decision**: Mock file system operations, test state transitions and UI feedback
**Rationale**: Tests actual behavior without file system side effects
**Alternatives considered**: Real file system testing (more complex, unnecessary for this scope)

### API Contract Testing
**Decision**: Test DELETE endpoints with various scenarios (existing session, non-existent session, error conditions)
**Rationale**: Ensures robust error handling and proper status codes
**Alternatives considered**: Integration tests only (insufficient coverage for edge cases)

## Key Constraints Identified

### Constitutional Constraints
- **Simplicity First**: No external dependencies, direct API calls, minimal UI changes
- **File-based Storage**: Must use existing storage layer, no database
- **Single Project**: Extend existing Next.js app, no separate services

### Technical Constraints
- **Existing API**: DELETE endpoint already exists, must work with current implementation
- **State Management**: Must maintain existing session/message relationship patterns
- **UI Consistency**: Must use existing components (Button, Card, etc.) and styling patterns
- **Error Handling**: Must follow existing console.error + try-catch patterns

### UX Constraints
- **Current Session Handling**: Must gracefully handle deletion of active session
- **Navigation Logic**: Must maintain session selection behavior after deletions
- **Performance**: Deletion operations must complete within existing patterns (< 5 seconds per spec)

## Implementation Dependencies

### Required Files to Modify
1. `/src/components/ChatInterface.tsx` - Add delete functionality
2. `/src/app/api/chat/sessions/route.ts` - Add bulk delete endpoint
3. Existing `/src/app/api/chat/sessions/[sessionId]/route.ts` - Already has DELETE

### Test Files to Create
1. Contract tests for DELETE endpoints
2. Component tests for delete UI interactions
3. Integration tests for deletion flows

### No New Dependencies Required
All functionality can be implemented with existing dependencies:
- React hooks for state management
- Existing UI components for interface
- Existing API patterns for backend
- Existing storage classes for persistence
