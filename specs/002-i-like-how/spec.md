# Feature Specification: Chat History Removal

**Feature Branch**: `002-i-like-how`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I like how @src/app/chat/ is but we need to add the possibility of remove the chat history,"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � Each requirement must be testable
   � Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   � All requirements clarified with common sense assumptions
   � If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### Specification Assumptions Applied
Based on common sense and standard chat application patterns:
- **User permissions**: All users can delete their own chat history
- **Data retention policy**: Deleted chat sessions are permanently removed with no recovery option
- **Performance**: Deletion operations complete within reasonable time (under 5 seconds)
- **Error handling**: Clear error messages displayed for network or system failures
- **Integration**: Works with existing chat session management system
- **Security**: Users can only delete their own chat data

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
Users want to be able to remove their chat history to manage privacy, free up storage space, or start fresh. They should be able to delete individual chat sessions or clear all chat history with appropriate confirmation to prevent accidental data loss.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user has multiple chat sessions, **When** they select a specific session and choose to delete it, **Then** that session and all its messages are permanently removed from the system
2. **Given** a user wants to clear all chat history, **When** they select "Clear All Chat History" option, **Then** a confirmation dialog appears requiring explicit confirmation before all sessions are deleted
3. **Given** a user attempts to delete chat history, **When** they cancel the confirmation dialog, **Then** no data is deleted and they return to the previous state
4. **Given** a user successfully deletes chat sessions, **When** they refresh or navigate away and return, **Then** the deleted sessions remain gone and do not reappear

### Edge Cases
- What happens when user tries to delete the currently active chat session?
- How does system handle deletion attempts when there's only one chat session remaining?
- What occurs if deletion fails due to system errors?
- How does the system behave when user has no chat history to delete?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to delete individual chat sessions
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to delete all chat history at once
- **FR-003**: System MUST require user confirmation before deleting any chat data
- **FR-004**: System MUST permanently remove deleted chat sessions and all associated messages
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide visual feedback when deletion operations are in progress
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle deletion of currently active sessions gracefully by switching to another session or creating a new one
- **FR-007**: System MUST prevent accidental deletions through confirmation dialogs
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide appropriate error messages if deletion operations fail
- **FR-009**: Users MUST be able to cancel deletion operations before confirmation
- **FR-010**: System MUST update the user interface immediately after successful deletions

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Chat Session**: Represents a conversation thread that can be individually deleted, contains metadata like creation date and title
- **Chat Message**: Individual messages within sessions that are deleted along with their parent session
- **Deletion Confirmation**: User confirmation state that prevents accidental data loss
