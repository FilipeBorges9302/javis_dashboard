# Implementation Plan: Spec Kit Dashboard

**Branch**: `001-spec-kit-dashboard` | **Date**: 2025-09-14 | **Spec**: [specs/001-spec-kit-dashboard/spec.md](/Users/jorgefiliperibeirovieiraborges/Desktop/MyJavis/DashBoard/specs/001-spec-kit-dashboard/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-spec-kit-dashboard/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
4. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
5. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, or `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI).
6. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
7. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
8. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
Web dashboard for managing AI agents and their memory system. Frontend-only application that connects to existing microservices (agents, RAG system, MCP server) via APIs. Personal use, no authentication, desktop-focused with simplicity as key requirement.

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+, Node.js 18+
**Primary Dependencies**: Next.js 14+ App Router, React 18+, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui
**Storage**: File-based JSON storage (no database)
**Testing**: Jest + React Testing Library
**Target Platform**: Modern web browsers (desktop/laptop development environments)
**Project Type**: web - determines source structure
**Performance Goals**: <2s page loads, <200ms interactions, real-time updates via SSE
**Constraints**: Personal use only, no authentication, no mobile compatibility, simplicity first
**Scale/Scope**: Single developer, local development environment, monitoring AI ecosystem

**Versioning**:

**Structure Decision**: Option 2 (Web application) - Frontend with Next.js API routes for backend functionality

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude` for your AI assistant
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Contract validation tasks: 4 API contract test suites (Chat, Memory, MCP, Agents) [P]
- Data model tasks: TypeScript interface definitions + validation schemas [P]
- Core component tasks: Navigation, ChatInterface, MemoryManager, MCPTools, AgentManager [P]
- API route implementation: 20+ endpoints following OpenAPI specs
- Integration tests: End-to-end user story validation (5 scenarios)
- File storage service: JSON file operations with error handling
- Real-time features: Server-Sent Events implementation

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Contract tests → Integration tests → Unit tests → Implementation
- Dependency order: Data models → Storage layer → API routes → Components → Pages
- Parallel execution groups: [P] Independent files, [S] Sequential dependencies
- File system setup → Data models [P] → Storage services [P] → API contracts [P] → Component tests [P] → Implementation

**Estimated Output**: 28-32 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md covering complete dashboard implementation

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| [e.g., 4th project] | [current need] | [why 3 projects insufficient] |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |


## Progress Tracking
*This checklist is updated during execution flow*

**Phase Status**:
- [x] Phase 0: Research complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 1: Design complete (/plan command)
- [x] Phase 2: Task planning complete (/plan command - describe approach only)
- [ ] Phase 3: Tasks generated (/tasks command)
- [ ] Phase 4: Implementation complete
- [ ] Phase 5: Validation passed

**Gate Status**:
- [x] Initial Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] Post-Design Constitution Check: PASS
- [x] All NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved
- [x] Complexity deviations documented (None - all constitutional requirements met)
