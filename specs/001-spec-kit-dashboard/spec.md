# Feature Specification: Spec Kit Dashboard

**Feature Branch**: `001-spec-kit-dashboard`
**Created**: 2025-09-14
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Build a web dashboard for managing AI agents and their memory system. The dashboard is a frontend-only application that connects to existing microservices (agents, RAG system, MCP server) via APIs."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   � Feature is a comprehensive dashboard for AI agent management
2. Extract key concepts from description
   � Actors: system administrators, AI agents, memory system
   � Actions: monitor, manage, configure, chat, search
   � Data: agent status, memory entries, logs, metrics
   � Constraints: frontend-only, connects to existing APIs
3. For each unclear aspect:
   � Authentication mechanisms marked for clarification
   � API specifications marked for clarification
   � Performance requirements marked for clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   � Primary workflow: admin monitors and manages AI system
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   � 15 testable requirements covering all dashboard features
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   � Agents, Memory Entries, MCP Tools, Logs, Metrics
7. Run Review Checklist
   � WARN "Spec has uncertainties" - clarifications needed
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning with clarifications)
```

## � Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### Specification Status
This specification has been refined for developer use with the following assumptions:
- Single local developer user (no authentication needed)
- Focus on workflow visibility and monitoring capabilities
- Standard web performance expectations for development environment
- Common sense error handling and retry behaviors
- Integration with existing microservice APIs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A developer needs a centralized dashboard to monitor and manage their AI ecosystem consisting of multiple agents, a memory/RAG system, and MCP tools. They want to observe real-time activity, debug issues, configure agent behavior, and interact directly with agents through a chat interface. The dashboard provides complete visibility into all agent-memory interactions and system health for development workflow optimization.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** the dashboard is loaded, **When** a developer views the main dashboard, **Then** they see active agent count, memory database size, recent activity feed, and system health indicators
2. **Given** a developer is on the chat page, **When** they select an agent from the sidebar, **Then** they can send messages and receive real-time responses with message history
3. **Given** a developer accesses the memory hub, **When** they search for specific memories, **Then** they see filtered results with categories and can manage entries
4. **Given** the MCP monitor is open, **When** an agent accesses memory, **Then** the developer sees real-time logs with agent identity, memory accessed, and response time
5. **Given** the agents page is loaded, **When** a developer views agent status, **Then** they see online/offline status and can configure permissions and rate limits

### Edge Cases
- What happens when all agents are offline?
- How does the system handle network connectivity issues with microservices?
- What occurs when memory storage reaches capacity limits?
- How are API connection timeouts displayed to the developer?
- What happens when MCP server connections are lost?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST display a main dashboard with real-time metrics including active agent count, memory database size, and system health indicators

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Agent**: Represents an AI agent with status (online/offline), performance metrics, permissions, rate limits, and model parameters
- **Memory Entry**: Individual memory records with content, categories, tags, creation/modification timestamps, and access frequency
- **MCP Tool**: Available tools with descriptions, parameter schemas, execution permissions, and usage statistics
- **Access Log**: Records of agent-memory interactions including agent identity, memory accessed, timestamp, response time, and operation status
- **Chat Session**: Communication sessions between users and agents with message history, timestamps, and file attachments
- **System Metrics**: Real-time data about system health, resource usage, active connections, and performance indicators
